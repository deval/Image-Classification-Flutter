# Image Classification Using Tensorflow Lite in Flutter
TensorFlow Lite is a mobile version of TensorFlow for deploying models on mobile devices.

### Installing TensorFlow Lite in Flutter
To use TensorFlow in your Flutter app, you need to install the following packages:

* **tflite_flutter**: allows you to access the native TensorFlow Lite library. When you invoke the methods of tflite_flutter, it calls the corresponding method of the native TensorFlow Lite SDK.

* **tflite_flutter_helper**: enables you to manipulate TensorFlow inputs and outputs. For example, it converts image data to tensor structure. It reduces the effort required to create pre- and post-processing logic for your model.
Open pubspec.yaml and add them in the dependencies section:
```
tflite_flutter: ^0.9.0
tflite_flutter_helper: ^0.3.1
```


**Note**: If you see an error like Class 'TfliteFlutterHelperPlugin' is not abstract and does not implement abstract member public abstract fun onRequestPermissionsResult(p0: Int, p1: Array<(out) String!>, p2: IntArray) it might be related to this issue. 

To work around it, replace the tflite_flutter_helper: ^0.3.1 dependency with the following git call:
```
tflite_flutter_helper:
 git:
  url: https://github.com/filofan1/tflite_flutter_helper.git
  ref: 783f15e5a87126159147d8ea30b98eea9207ac70
```

Then, if you are building for Android, run the installation script below on macOS/Linux:
```
./install.sh 
```
If youâ€™re on Windows, run install.bat instead:
```
install.bat 
```


**1. Copy all these lines on notepad:**

```
@echo off
setlocal enableextensions

cd %~dp0

```


**2. Save the file as install.bat and put the file in root directory of your project.**

**3. then run following in terminal**

```
.\install.bat
```
